* File Structure
Everything lives under ~.emacs.d~. ~init.el~ is the entry point. This
file set up the paths where everything else is found.

Paths:
- ~lisp~ :: elisp code I've written.
- ~mytemplates~ :: Autoinsert file templates.
- ~snippets~ :: Text snippets for yasnippets.
- ~user~ :: Machine specific customisations.
- ~vendor~ :: Third party packages. Where possible I'm moving to using
              submodules to track these from upstream.

* Packages
Where ever possible I'm using package.el to manage these. I have
[[http://mepla.org][melpa]] set up in addition to the default gnu elpa.

There are still a very modes that aren't available as packages. These
are checked in under ~vendor/~.

* Applications

** Org mode

** Deft

** Gnus

** Magit

** Dired

* Auto Typing
I like to make the computer do as much of my work as I possibly can.
Hence I've spend a bit of time on the various auto typing features.

+ ~sourcekit-lsp~
